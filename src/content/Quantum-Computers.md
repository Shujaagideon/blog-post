## The race to Quantum Computing.

The term itself feels scary doesn't it? it looks like a deep and intrinsic term in the prospect of quantum physics. Well it is, but don't get scared as we don't need to understand all those quirky stuff as the geniuses already figured them out for us. What we need to do is narrow down to how quantum computers work and the basics that can get us up and running with quantum computers. Here we will talk about four topics. How the quantum computer works, what makes it different from classical computers, where quantum computing is currently and why quantum computers might be our next biggest milestone in the field of computing and hopefully this will give you a solid footing into quantum computing.

### How quantum computers work

So let us start with how they work. With classical computers, data is represented in bits and transistors are used to alter the flow of electric currents in oder to denote an on (1) or an off (0). This is not so with quantum computers. With quantum computers, instead of bits, qubits are used and instead of transistors, sub-atomic particles are used. This is where quantum magic starts. Charged ions are the sub-atomic particles and they represent the qubits.

> The question then is what are qubits and how do they represent 0s and 1s?

Qubits are different from classical bits in that qubits can either represent 0s or 1s or both at the same time. But how you may ask. Since qubits are ions they take a spherical shape. The northern side will be the 1 and the southern side will be the 0 so if the qubit is measured and the charges face north then it is a 1 and if it faces south then it is a 0. What if it faces somewhere else in the sphere where it isn't north or south then we say it is in a superposition which basically means it is representing a zero and a one at the same time only that the probability varies and only when you measure will it be forced to fall to a 0 or a 1. Example, if you have someone prepare both tea and coffee then brings you a cup, you can never know what is in the cup until you look inside. the cup could be having a 50 50 probability of having either coffee or tea but you can never know until you ask or look into the cup. This means, when in superposition, the qubit is representing both the 1 and the zero and only if you decide to measure will it fall to either a 1 or a 0.

The next magic is what is called entanglement which basically means that if two qubits are entangled then if one is measured to be a 1 then the other will instantaneously be measure to be the opposite which in this case is a 0 regardless of the distance between them. This sounds like magic since then this means that information would be transmitted faster than the speed of light which beats newton's law of relativity. Anyway lets leave the technical part to the geniuses and focus on the quantum computer itself.

### The differences between the classical and quantum computer and where quantum computers are currently.

To begin with quantum computers have an immense processing power. A normal bit can only represent 2 states a a time a one or a zero that means that finding its processing power is number of bits multiplied by 2. But in a quantum computer a qubit can represent a 1, a 0 and both states at the same time meaning that its processing power is 2 to the power of the number of qubits. This increases exponentially with the increase in qubits thus making them extremely more powerful than classical computers. This makes a huge difference in processing of data in that while classical computers can process data sequentially, quantum computers process all the data available simultaneously. This eventually leads to quantum supremacy.
>Quantum Supremacy-->

> This is where quantum computers have a higher processing power and can tackle complex problems in a very short period of time compared to classical computers which would take years to tackle the same problem.


Quantum computers at least are not a speculation anymore as several tech giants like IBM, Google, Microsoft, Rigetti, D-wave, amazon and other mighty agencies in their field like NASA having quantum computers and some even offering them on the cloud. D-wave officially started producing commercial quantum computers. IBM made their quantum computer accessible through the IBMQ platform which allows anyone to interact with their quantum computers from anywhere around the world. To even go further the IBM team released an open source library called qiskit that allows python developers to interact better with the quantum computers.

>DID YOU KNOW??  these processors are stored in a freezer that cools them to temperatures colder than outer space to prevent interference by heat energy.

Not so fast anyway, quantum computers are still in their infancy stage where you are still programming in the qubit level. Well this brings us to the next topic.

### Where can we apply quantum computers

Well lets start with a simple example. I am arranging a fundraising event and I have invited 5 of my good friends Jacob, John, Caleb, Claudius and Mark. Well Jacob is a crowd follower and will give more if he sees the one sitting next to him giving more but he hate Caleb. with John, he is very temperamental and very talkative and if in the right mood will give a lot. Caleb is very nudging but is great at giving but he is not in good terms with Claudius. Claudius in the other hand is relaxed and doesn't like talkative people but loves his calm. Finally Mark loves everything except boring silence. All these 5 guests are going to be sit on the same table. Now the possibilities of arranging the 5 is the factorial of 5 which is 120 possible ways. If we feed this information to a classical computer and tell it to sample through this problem and give us an optimal sitting plan where the giving won't be affected by the individual's preferences, then the classical computer will go through each of the sitting arrangement one by one taking into consideration all the parameters until it hits the 120 possibilities. 120 might not seem much but the number increases with an increase in the number of people if the number increases to 6 then there are 720 possibilities and this significantly takes a longer time. But with a quantum computer, this will probably take a very short time. This is because it will go through all the possibilities simultaneously taking the parameters into consideration instead of going through them one by one like in the case of a classical computer. 

>This has been quite a basic example lets see now the real catch.

This can quite be useful in the real world. This will help solve complex problems like drawing and simulating of atoms which is very important in medical researches. This will also help significantly solve in complex risk analysis and planning, weather forecasting, transport and communication to aid find the optimal pathways that will cut cost while saving efficiency and time. This is just but a few examples as there are still more field like artificial intelligence where machines will be able to simultaneously go through tonnes of data and effectively come up with urgent solutions much faster than we know.

Well this post is becoming longer than expected so this is the end of the road for me. For those who want to know how they can get into th field, there are various node from where they can get into quantum computing. For instance 

if you are a researcher,

you can probably get into quantum computing error correction, quantum applications, multi-qubit gates optimization, quantum transduction e.t.c. 

If you are a software developer,

you can get into architecture,system software and firmware engineering, compiler design, program language design, qiskit, user experience design, DevOps, security, cloud services and apis e.t.c.

If you are a hardware developer

you can get into quantum engineering, micro fabrication(lithography and Josephson junction growth), quantum control and classical electronic, circuit design, chip design and layout, low-power cryoelecronics e.t.c
