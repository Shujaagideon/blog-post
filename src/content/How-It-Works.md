## Who doesn't like Food

Just the other day in the restaurant with a good friend the waiter approached and asked what I would like for lunch well am not really good at choosing so I Went with good old noodles with some beef stew and some pepper to taste.

> Noodles really ?!  was there no better choice!!

I know. I am so bad at choosing but anyway, that aside, what went on during the conversation is the simplest key to understanding basically how a computer works. So what happened? Lets break this into three simple segments:
 - The question the waiter asked.
 - The time I took thinking of the best response.
 - The response it self.

Let us try to define what a computer is. This is a device that takes input processes the input and gives back an output relevant to the input.


> so what about all those noodles

Back to the noodles. So when the waiter was asking me what food I was going to eat, he was basically giving me a set of instructions, which is the input, which in much simpler terms he was asking my brain to think of which food I would prefer eating. Then I took My time to Think of the food I was going to eat. This is the processing time in a computer. finally I gave him a relevant response which is equivalent to output.

>So a computer imitates the human mind?

You can say so. For example, when you press the key _"A"_ on the keyboard of your phone or computer, you are essentially trying to tell the computer to print the letter _"A"_ on the screen so the information is taken to the brain of the computer where the information is processed and finally you see the letter _"A"_ on the screen.

>Well if you guessed that the keyboard is an input device and the screen monitor an output device you guessed it right.

 Okay I wont bore you with any more question but the next intriguing question that you should ask your self is how does computer know that I am pressing the key _"A"_ and not another key? and how does that information move to the brain of the computer? In fact what is the brain of the computer?


 In the next part we will talk about the hardware the tangible part of the computer.
