## __The cruel rise of technology__

Though we are overly excited to live in such an era where everything is just a click away, technology may just have more to offer than we know or perhaps think. The common saying that:  _ _"you are only limited by your imaginations"_ _ may very soon be literal rather than its common meaning. The recent past has seen an exponential growth in the level of technological inventions, so rapid the growth has been that the rate of adoption of these technologies is like a grain of sand in a beach. This has brought about speculations and nagging questions of wether these sophisticated pieces of technology may soon overwhelm human kind and bring a catastrophic turn of events. Well the reality is that this has been the case for quite some time now.

One thing for sure, these gadgets know you better than you know them and this,this is a huge point of concern. logically, anything that possesses a lot of personal information on you has a great influence on your overall self.Well I know this seems to be inevitable so why bother. What if I told you that there might be a way around this, or better, a way that we can use this to our advantage.
