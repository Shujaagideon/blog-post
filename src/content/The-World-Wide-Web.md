## World Wide Web


Have you ever wondered how the web became a phenomenal worldwide technology and a part of our daily lives?. You might as well be surprised that its actual purpose was for scientific sharing of data and findings by physicists at CERN, a scientific and nuclear research institute in switzerland. Going back to around 1980, an independent contractor at CERN known as Tim Berners-Lee started working on a way in which information can be shared by scientist in the institute. This was because back then, there was a difficulty in acquiring information and findings and sharing of the data. He realized that he could use the internet that was present at the institution to link the files such that they can all be accessed from one location.

>Just Incase you didn't know, Internet is different from the web. The web is just part of the internet as the internet contains more than just the web

There was a problem though,
 - How was this going to be achieved?
 - In what manner would the document be indented and          displayed? 
 - How would another computer on that internet receive information?
 - What if the computers were not of the same make?
 - From what interface were the people going to access the information?.

Fortunately, Mr Lee thought this through and finally came up with four basic components that performed this task and finally the World Wide Web was born,which is simply an inter-connection of files from all around the world.

First, to solve how computers of different make could access the web and how how this information was to be transported and received by other computers on the same internet, he came up with a set of rules on how all computer needed to communicate over the web. These rules are called HTTP (Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol).

Secondly he needed a way to structure the information so that headings could be distinguished from paragraph, sub-headings from main headings and  the general structuring of the document. So he came up with a language called HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language). This was language of the web and used tags to specify how the text should look when displayed on the screen.

Thirdly, he made the first browser so that people could search for these information. And finally he made a server that would receive the requests from the client and serve them with the relevant information. And this is how it all began.

Around 1992 this idea had spread ad now information was being shared by researchers and institutions around the globe. Because this was the era where 2G internet access was spreading like wild fire, people were not limited to sending text documents, as this had opened doors for transfer of large data and multimedia files across the internet through the web. Then around 1990s, a group of ingenious computer science graduates, Larry Page, Sergy Brind and Scott Hassan came up with a search engine that indexed the pages on the web and used an algorithm that made it easier to access the files that you needed from the web faster and with well over 80% possibility that you will find the information that you are looking for.

>The word google comes from the word Googol which is a very large number. Actually it is 1 with 100 Zeros

Google has since raised to be the number one search engine with a 'googol' of visitors everyday. This has been made possible as the growth of the web has been tremendous over the years.

That was just the tip of the ice berg.Stay tuned to learn the full journey. From how Styling of the web pages made them appealing and more easy to interact with the web, to how Javascript even took thing further and Suddenly, animations and functionality were simplified, then the rise of web technologies that have revolutionized the way websites are being made and customized in the current world to enabled e-commerce, e-learning, marketing and many more possibilities.

Before we part, this has just been the bare-bones of how the web came into existence. Be sure to subscribe and stay around as we will soon be looking at the magnificent transition of the web from the 20<sup>th</sup> to the 21<sup>st</sup> century and what the internet holds for the future.
