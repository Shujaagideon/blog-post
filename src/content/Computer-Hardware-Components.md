## Computer Hardware Components.

Computer hardware components are the tangible parts of the computer. For generations, computer hardware engineers have been working tirelessly to revolutionize computer hardware components for easier mobility, faster speeds and customized to user's desires and taste. Some hardware components have been faced out or replaced by other components to increase efficiency and to cut on costs but in most cases the bare essentials still survive and some include,
  - Monitor
  - Keyboard
  - Mouse
  - Graphics cards
  - Gaming console
  - Printers
  - speakers

There are numerous hardware components and exhausting them all is extremely hard. So, we are going to narrow down to what is the computer itself, the motherboard. On opening the System Unit, the most obvious thing you see is the motherboard. At a glance the mother board has numerous component that are planted on a green or blue board. Let us see the basic and most fundamental parts of the motherboard.

  ### The Printed Circuit Board (PCB).

This is the largest component of the motherboard and it is here that all other components on the motherboard are mounted. This component contains numerous number of copper wires running through it which connects the entire system.

> Did you know? the copper wires running on a simple device's Circuit Board e.g. a mobile phone are as long as 110M which is slightly longer than the football field

These wires are prevented from touching each other by an epoxy-raisin binder which is a non conductive material that forms the green or bluish part of the board.

  ### The Processor (CPU).

The processor is the brain of the computer and it is here that complex arithmetic and logical operations take place in the computer. It is mostly behind a fan for cooling , this is because there is usually a lot of heat produced during the calculations. The processor is a complex component and a lot of this will be discussed in a latter post specifically on the processor.

  ### The Random Access Memory (RAM) & Their slots.

The RAM is a chip that provides temporary storage for processes that are being run on the processor. The RAM is attached to a RAM slot that is usually located close to the processor for faster transfer of data and information to and from the processor. 

  ### The ChipSet.

It is as it sounds, a collection of chips. On earlier versions of the motherboard, the chips for peripherals, memory, PCIs and other components were scattered all over the board. This was very inconvenient and was a factor that reduced the performance of the computer. After years of research, computer hardware engineers condensed the chips to a centralized place to control the movement of data between the CPU and the other components. This brought about the ChipSet. This is just a middle man aiding in easier and faster communication between the Processor and other components. There are two ChipSets, the north bridge and the south bridge. In newer versions of the motherboards, these two have also been merged and a Front-Side-Bus connects the ChipsSet to the processor.


other essential parts include;

### Peripheral Components Inter-connect (PCI).

These slots allow for the expansion of the capabilities of your computer. Graphics Cards, sound cards, network cards, USB C cards can be connected to this slots to enable the computer to perform other functions that the computer wasn't performing initially.

### SATA slots
These ports connects drives to your computer. Hard drives, optical drives and other drives are connected to the computer via the SATA slots

### The ROM

This is a piece of hardware mounted on the motherboard and contains the system firmware, which is essentially the system specification and manufacture information.

 ### The CMOS

the CMOS is a device and store information e.g. the time, and passwords, that is loaded onto the BIOS during booting of the device. It is powered by a CMOS battery and always stays running even when the computer is off.
